This program allows a user to load an entire dictionary (by default it is the entire english dictionary).
Once the user has loaded a dictionary, they have the choice to either:

- Search for a word - Displays the word, its definition and if its a noun, adjective, verb, etc.
- Find and display every word that has more than three "z"s in it
- Add a word to the dictionary file
- Find all palindromes
- Search for words that rhyme with the users input
- Guess the fourth word from a definition from a randomly chosen word - A highscore is recorded for every correct answer the user gets consecutively.
- Cheat at the Searchdle game - The user will be asked multiple prompts that will lead to a list of possible words that the Searchdle answer could be.
